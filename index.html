        Mexico,[a][b] officially the United<span style="color: blue;"> Mexican States,[c] is a country in the southern
            portion of</span> North America. It
        is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by
        Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico.[11] Mexico covers 1,972,550
        square kilometers (761,610 sq mi),[12] making it the world's 13th-largest country by area; with approximately
        126,014,024 inhabitants,[1] it is the 10th-most-populous country and has the most Spanish-speakers. Mexico is
        organized as a federation comprising 31 states and Mexico City,[13] its capital and largest metropolis. Other
        major urban areas include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana, Ciudad Juárez, and León.[14]
        Pre-Columbian Mexico traces its origins to 8,000 BC and is identified as one of the six cradles of
        civilization;[15] it was home to many advanced Mesoamerican civilizations, most notably the Maya and the Aztecs.
        In 1521, the Spanish Empire conquered and colonized the region from its base in Mexico City, establishing the
        colony of New Spain. The Catholic Church played an important role in spreading Christianity and the Spanish
        language, while also preserving some indigenous elements.[16] Native populations were subjugated and heavily
        exploited to mine rich deposits of precious metals, which contributed to Spain's status as a major world power
        for the next three centuries,[17] and to a massive influx of wealth and a price revolution in Western
        Europe.[18] Over time, a distinct Mexican identity formed, based on a fusion of European and indigenous customs;
        this contributed to the successful Mexican War of Independence against Spain between 1810 and 1821.[19] Mexico's
        early history as an independent nation state was marked by political and socioeconomic upheaval, with liberal
        and conservative factions constantly changing the form of government. The country was invaded by two foreign
        powers during the 19th century: first, after the Texas Revolution by American settlers, which led to the
        Mexican–American War and huge territorial losses to the United States in 1848.[20] Liberal reforms were
        enshrined in the Constitution of 1857, which sought to integrate indigenous communities and curtail the power of
        the military and the church, granting religious freedom for the first time. This triggered an internal war of
        Reform and intervention by France, during which conservatives installed Maximilian Habsburg as emperor against
        the Republican resistance led by Benito Juárez. The last decades of the 19th century were marked by the
        dictatorship of President Porfirio Díaz, who sought to modernize Mexico and restore order.[19] The Porfiriato
        era ended in 1910 with the decade-long Mexican civil war (Mexican Revolution), which killed approximately 10% of
        the population and after which the victorious Constitutionalist faction drafted an even more socially-oriented
        1917 Constitution, which remains in effect to this day. The revolutionary generals ruled as a succession of
        presidents until the assassination of Alvaro Obregón in 1928. This led to the formation of the Institutional
        Revolutionary Party the following year, which pseudo-democratically governed Mexico until 2000; first under a
        paternalistic center-left model of considerable economic success, which transitioned into a more US-aligned
        neoliberal model since the 1980s.[21][22][23][24] Mexico is a developing country, ranking 74th on the Human
        Development Index, but has the world's 15th-largest economy by nominal GDP and the 11th-largest by PPP, with the
        United States being its largest economic partner.[25][26] Its large economy and population, global cultural
        influence, and steady democratization make Mexico a regional and middle power;[27][28][29][30] it is often
        identified as an emerging power but is considered a newly industrialized state by several
        analysts.[31][32][33][34][35] However, the country continues to struggle with social inequality, poverty and
        extensive crime. It ranks poorly on the Global Peace Index,[36] due in large part to ongoing conflict between
        the government and drug trafficking syndicates, violently competing for the US market and trade routes. This
        "drug war" has led to over 120,000 deaths since 2006.[37] Mexico ranks first in the Americas and seventh in the
        world for the number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.[38][39][40] It is also one of the world's 17 megadiverse
        countries, ranking fifth in natural biodiversity.[41] Mexico's rich cultural and biological heritage, as well as
        varied climate and geography, makes it a major tourist destination: as of 2018, it was the sixth most-visited
        country in the world, with 39 million international arrivals.[42] Mexico is a member of United Nations, the G20,
        the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the
        Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, the Organization of American States, Community of Latin American and
        Caribbean States, and the Organization of Ibero-American States.

    <h2> Bit Of History</h2>
    <p dir="ltr">
        Tulum was the last great city constructed and inhabited by the Mayan people between the thirteenth and fifteenth
        centuries. It was a site of worship to the Great <i>Descending God whose image adorns</i> the temples within the site.
        Tulum was also of great importance for sea trade, most specifically for the trading of obsidian. Tribes from all
        over Mexico and other Central American countries would travel here for commerce. It’s said that the great wall
        around the city was erected to protect it from envious traders and pirates who wanted to steal the prime
        location for themselves.</p>
    <h2>Tulum Today</h2>
    <p dir="ltr">
        The pull of ancient Mayan energies combined with the magic of the natural wonders and historic sites, have been
        bringing in spiritually centered tourism for decades now. Once a quiet, beach town with slowly wandering yogis
        and
        artists, Tulum has developed into a thriving tourism hot spot. Modern hotels and amenities are now available but
        don’t worry, there is still plenty of the Mayan spirit to discover. Below is our guide to making the best of
        your
        visit to Tulum. We hope you enjoy!</p>

        Playa del Carmen (Spanish pronunciation: ['plaʝa ðel 'kaɾmen]) is a city located along the Caribbean Sea in the
        municipality of Solidaridad, in the state of Quintana Roo, Mexico. It is a popular tourist area in eastern
        Mexico. Playa del Carmen features a wide array of tourist activities due to its geographical location in the
        Riviera Maya. It has also been the destination of PGA Tour golf tournaments and the set location for various
        television shows. The town has one of the fastest-growing populations in Mexico.
    </p>

    <h2>Tourism</h2>
    <p>
        Originally a small fishing town, tourism to Playa del Carmen began with the passenger ferry service to Cozumel,
        an island across the Cozumel Channel and a world-famous scuba diving destination.

        Playa del Carmen has recently undergone extremely rapid development with new luxury residential condominium
        buildings, restaurants, boutiques, and entertainment venues. Tourist activity in Playa del Carmen centers on
        Quinta Avenida, or Fifth Avenue, which stretches from Calle 1 norte to Calle 40. A pedestrian walkway located
        just one or two blocks inland from the beach, Fifth Avenue is lined with hundreds of shops, bars, and
        restaurants. There are many small boutique hotels on and just off Fifth Avenue and on the beach.

        Playacar is a residential and tourist development in Playa del Carmen just south of the main urban area. Most of
        the all-inclusive hotels, the aviary, and the golf course are located in this development. There are two phases
        – phase 1 is mostly residential with a few hotels and some stores, while phase 2 contains the largest
        all-inclusive resorts as well as the golf course and a significant number of residential properties.
    </p>
    <h2>Sports</h2>
    <p>
        The city is home to Inter Playa del Carmen, an association football club founded in 1999, which competes in the
        south group of the Segunda División Profesional, the third tier of Mexican football league system.

        The World Wide Technology Championship at Mayakoba is a PGA Tour FedEx Cup golf tournament held at El Camaleón
        Golf Club since 2007. Since 2013, it has been a full-points tournament where the winner earns full rights for a
        PGA TOUR win.

    <p>
        Cozumel (Spanish pronunciation: [kosuˈmel], Yucatec Maya: Kùutsmil) is an island and municipality in the
        Caribbean Sea off the eastern coast of Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula, opposite Playa del Carmen. It is separated
        from the mainland by Cozumel Channel and is close to the Yucatán Channel. The municipality is part of the state
        of Quintana Roo, Mexico.

        The economy of Cozumel is based on tourism, with visitors able to benefit from the island's balnearios, scuba
        diving, and snorkeling. The main town on the island is San Miguel de Cozumel.
    </p>
    <h2>Five Facts About Cozumel</h2>

    <ol dir="ltr">
        <li>Cozumel is believed to have been first settled by the Mayans. There are 24 ancient ruins on the island,
            such
            as San Gervasio, which are easily accessible to tourists. The Mayans settled here around 2000 years ago.
        </li>
        <br><br>
        <li>Mayans named the island Cozumel, <strong> or Cuzamil, which translates to</strong>  the land of the swallow.</li>
        <br><br>
        <li>There are a fair number of swallows in Cozumel. There are also 5 species of birds that are completely
            endemic to the island — meaning the only place in the world they reside in is on this island. Three endemic
            mammals and one endemic fish also make Cozumel their home</li>
        <br><br>
        <li>Many of these endemic species can be seen at<u>Chankanaab National Park.</u>  This park was set up under
            protection
            by the Mexican government in 1980 to protect the many natural treasures of Cozumel. Chankanaab has beautiful
            beaches and hiking trails, making it a great outdoor activity space. This National Park is also a very
            popular place to dive, as you can rent equipment right out of the park.</li>
        <br><br>
        <li>Scuba diving and snorkeling are the main reason many people come to Cozumel. The average temperature of
            the island hovers near 80 degrees year-round and the waters have 150-250 feet of visibility. The clear water
            helps sunlight hit deeper depths of the water, allowing coral to grow deeper and be more protected. Cozumel
            sits on a 600 mile coral reef system — the second largest in the world. Many of the all-inclusive resorts
            also offer snorkeling adventures and packages.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1 style="background-color: rgb(85, 100, 0);text-align: center;">The national dish</h1>
    <h2>taco</h2>
    <p>
        A taco (US: /ˈtɑːkoʊ/, UK: /ˈtækoʊ/, Spanish: [ˈtako]) is a traditional Mexican dish consisting of a small
        hand-sized corn or wheat tortilla topped with a filling. The tortilla is then folded around the filling and
        eaten by hand. A taco can be made with a variety of fillings, including beef, pork, chicken, seafood, beans,
        vegetables, and cheese, allowing for great versatility and variety. They are often garnished with various
        condiments, such as salsa, guacamole, or sour cream, and vegetables, such as lettuce, onion, tomatoes, and
        chiles. Tacos are a common form of antojitos, or Mexican street food, which have spread around the world.

        Tacos can be contrasted with similar foods such as burritos, which are often much larger and rolled rather than
        folded; taquitos, which are rolled and fried; or chalupas/tostadas, in which the tortilla is fried before
        filling.
